<hr>
<p><span class='lettrine'>S</span><strong>omeone</strong> recently asked me for reading
suggestions to learn more about differential privacy (DP). I thought that the
answer was worth posting somewhere. So, here it is: a list of material that I
often recommend to people who want to dive into the field.</p>
<p>Before I start, two remarks. First, most of these are going to be research
papers. There's a lack of accessible material on differential privacy. I hope it
gets better over time; I'll keep this list updated as I discover more good
stuff. Second, this list is going to be <em>very</em> subjective. I'm more interested
in some problems than others. I like beautiful theory and very practical
applications. I'm less enthusiastic about the research in-between. This list
might not be the right one for you. If you're a student starting a research
project, ask your advisor what you should read! They'll be a better source of
reading material than a random guy on the Internet.</p>
<h1 id="introductory-and-reference-material">Introductory and reference material</h1>
<p>There are less links that I'd like in the category « suitable for a
non-technical audience ». That's exactly why I'm writing these blog posts…
Still, some people have created great material.</p>
<p>I recently stumbled upon a fantastic 12-minute video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT19VwBAqKA">Protecting Privacy
with MATH</a>. It's done by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinutePhysics">MinutePhysics</a>, and it's friendly,
understandable, yet very accurate. I love that it explains the basics of
reconstruction attacks! It provides a great motivation for differential privacy.</p>
<p>For more in-depth material, I recommend the <a href="https://scholarship.law.vanderbilt.edu/jetlaw/vol21/iss1/4/">Primer for a Non-Technical
Audience</a>. It's written by folks at the Harvard <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/">Privacy Tools
Project</a>, and is perfect if you don't want heavy math. I prefer it to
the typical recommendation for a reference book on DP, surnamed the « Privacy
Book ». Its real name is <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/privacybook.html">The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential
Privacy</a>. One of the authors is Cynthia Dwork, one of the creators
of DP, so it's a good way of discovering the original motivations… But I would
mostly recommend Sections 1 to 3, not the whole thing.</p>
<p>Ah, on the topic of things written by the creators of DP! <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog">Frank McSherry's
blog</a> makes for a fun read (look for the articles tagged « Privacy »).</p>
<h1 id="local-and-shuffled-model">Local and shuffled model</h1>
<p>Excited by my [blog post][local] about the different models of DP? When it comes
to the privacy model, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6981">RAPPOR</a> paper is a classic. It explains how Google
Chrome collected useful statistics without learning information about
individuals. The follow-up paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00901">Prochlo</a>, introduced the shuffled model in a
very practical context. To understand its theoretical guarantees, I recommend
the later <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02837">Privacy Blanket</a> paper, it provides a very nice explanation
of the intuition behind it<sup id="fnref:shuffling"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:shuffling">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h1 id="rolling-out-differential-privacy">Rolling out differential privacy</h1>
<p>Moving on to applied views of central DP for statistics. Google colleagues and I
recently published recently a paper about a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01917">differentially private SQL
engine</a>. This isn't the first work in that direction<sup id="fnref:sql"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sql">2</a></sup>, but I'm still
pretty proud of it: we worked hard to make it easy to understand and mostly
self-contained! You can see an updated version in Section 4.2 of my <a href="https://desfontain.es/thesis/">PhD
thesis</a>. Further in the thesis, you can also find a discussion of
<a href="https://desfontain.es/thesis/OperationalAspectsOfAnonymization.html">operational aspects of DP</a>, a topic that doesn't get as much
attention as it probably should.</p>
<p>Want more about rolling out DP in practice? The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02201">Issues Encountered Deploying
Differential Privacy</a> paper, by the US Census Bureau, is a must-read. I
strongly relate to the problems it raises. For even more fun and absurd
implementation things, go read about the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/on-significance-of-the-least-significant-bits-for-differential-privacy/">floating-point attack</a> on
the Laplace mechanism, it's a classic. </p>
<h1 id="theory-of-differential-privacy">Theory of differential privacy</h1>
<p>There are natural theory questions raised by DP. For example « how many queries
can we answer privately and accurately on the same database? » <a href="https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/publications/complexity-differential-privacy">The Complexity
of Differential Privacy</a> is a survey of fundamental results on
accuracy/privacy trade-offs. This being theory, almost everything in there is
asymptotic, of course.</p>
<p>The theory around the <em>privacy loss distribution</em> is beautiful. It gives a
global view of the privacy leakage of a mechanism. It's less simple, but it
makes much more sense than only considering a pair of (ε,δ) parameters. To learn
about it, I recommend the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/820">Privacy Loss Classes</a> paper. It has practical
consequences, too, on estimating privacy budgets over many compositions. It
enables neat ways of estimating the evolution of a privacy budget over many
compositions. This is explored in the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1034">Privacy Buckets</a> paper, which is
also worth a read.</p>
<p>Speaking of interesting reformulations of DP, the hypothesis testing formulation
is also super cool. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02383">Gaussian Differential Privacy</a> paper does a
great job at explaining it. It also gives you nice results on <em>amplification by
sampling</em>, a shiny and useful tool in practice<sup id="fnref:sampling"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sampling">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, there are interesting debates around how to interpret the guarantee
provided by DP. Everyone understands the math, but how do we translate it in
practice? There's a long-standing debate about data correlations and adversary
strength. On that topic, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05899">Differential Privacy as a Causal Property</a>
paper is fantastic. It clarifies this debate, links to all relevant references,
and proposes a neat way to solve this issue conceptually.</p>
<h1 id="differentially-private-machine-learning">Differentially private machine learning</h1>
<p>I don't know much about machine learning, but it felt weird to not mention it at
all in an article like this. So I asked my colleague <a href="https://ai.google/research/people/PeterKairouz">Peter Kairouz</a> to
suggest some material! The following suggestions are from him. I was glad to see
that there aren't only scientific papers in there!</p>
<p>First, start with this pretty great 2-hour <a href="https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~asarwate/nips2017/">video tutorial</a> (with
available slides and historical references). If you then want to actually test
this in practice, try out <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy">TensorFlow Privacy</a>! For a nice introduction to
it, check out this <a href="http://www.cleverhans.io/privacy/2019/03/26/machine-learning-with-differential-privacy-in-tensorflow.html">blog post</a>, by one of the TensorFlow Privacy
authors. It explains how to run DP-SGD with it, step by step and with a lot of
additional references.</p>
<p>The paper that introduced DP-SGD is a classic: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133">Deep Learning with Differential
Privacy</a>. Another method for the same problem, DSSGD, appeared earlier in
<a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~reza/files/Shokri-CCS2015.pdf">Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning</a><sup>(PDF)</sup>. Yet another
alternative approach, more generic and surprisingly understandable, is called
PATE. It's described in a <a href="http://www.cleverhans.io/privacy/2018/04/29/privacy-and-machine-learning.html">blog post</a>, which comes with references to the
original papers.</p>
<p>Most of these methods rely on tight accounting on the privacy budget. A common
tool for that is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07476">Rényi Differential Privacy</a>, a DP variant that
considers the <em>averaged</em> privacy loss. Another is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06651">Amplification by
Iteration</a>, which studies mechanisms that iterate over the data
multiple times, without releasing intermediary results. Both techniques enable
better composition results.</p>
<p>Deep learning isn't the only interesting ML application of differential privacy.
Methods also exist for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02482">Ordinary Least Squares</a>, or for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0071">Empirical Risk
Minimization</a>. This last method admits <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7085">Efficient Algorithms and Tight
Error Bounds</a>. In general, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09970">Convex Optimization</a> problems are a nice
fit for DP methods.</p>
<h1 id="something-missing">Something missing?</h1>
<p>If you feel this reading list is missing something, please let me know! I'd like
this post to be a living resource. So I'm enthusiastic about adding new
material, especially if they're more approchable than scientific papers. My
contact info is in the footer of this page.</p>
