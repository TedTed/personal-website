    <p><strong>Suppose</strong> that you're a doctor who studies human sexual behavior. You want to
run a study with all the patients that you can find, but you don't find a lot of
volunteers. You only end up with about 40 subjects.</p>
<p>After you've ran your study and collected data, you want to share this data with
other researchers. You look at the attributes, and deduce that ZIP code and age
are likely to be used in reidentification attacks. To share it in a safe way,
you're thinking of <a href="k-anonymity.html"><span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity</a>.</p>
<p>When trying to find a strategy to obtain <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity, you find out that you
would have to lose a lot of information. For <span class="math">\(k=10\)</span>, a rather small value, you
end up with buckets like <span class="math">\(20\le age\lt 50\)</span>. That makes sense: you have only few
people in your database, so you have to bundle together very different age
values.</p>
<p>But when you think about it, you start questioning whether you really need
<span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity. Who are the attackers, in your scenario? The researchers with
whom you share the data, and possibly unknown parties if the data ever leaks.
None of these people have background information about who is in the dataset.
Thus, the attacker doesn't just have to distinguish between different records,
but to actually find the <em>real identity</em> of a record based on its information.
This attacker has significantly weaker capabilities than for <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity!</p>
<p>Let's look at two different rows in this database.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">ZIP code</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">age</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">85535</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">79</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">60629</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">42</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>At first glance, the amount of information for this two individuals seems to be
the same. But let's take a look at the values…</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/85535/">85535</a> corresponds to a place in Arizona named Eden. Approximately 20 people
  live in this ZIP code. How many people do you think are exactly 79 years old
  in this particular ZIP code? Probably only one.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/60629/">60629</a> corresponds to a part of the Chicago metropolitan area. More than
  100,000 people live there. How many of them are 42 years old? A thousand, at
  least, and probably more!</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that it would be very easy to reidentify the first row, but that we
don't have enough information to reidentify the second row. But according to
<span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity, both rows might be completely unique in the dataset.</p>
<p>Obviously, <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity doesn't fit this use case. We need a different
definition: that's where <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map comes in.</p>
<h1 id="definition">Definition</h1>
<p>Just like <a href="k-anonymity.html"><span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity</a>, <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map requires you to determine
which columns of your database are <em>quasi-identifiers</em>. This answers the
question: what can your attacker use to reidentify their target?</p>
<p>But this information alone is not enough to compute <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map. In the example
above, we assumed that the attacker doesn't know whether their target is in the
dataset. So what are they comparing a given row with? With all other individuals
sharing the same values in a larger, sometimes implicit, dataset. For the
previous example, this could be "everybody living in the US", if you assume the
attacker has no idea who could have this genetic disease. Let's call this larger
table the <em>reidentification dataset</em>.</p>
<p>Once you picked the quasi-identifiers and the reidentification dataset, the
definition is straightforward. Your data satisfies <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map if every combination
of values for the quasi-identifiers appears at least <span class="math">\(k\)</span> times <em>in the
reidentification dataset</em>.</p>
<p>In our example, this corresponds to counting the number of people in the US who
share the quasi-identifier values of each row in your dataset. Consider our tiny
dataset above:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">ZIP code</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">age</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">85535</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">79</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">60629</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">42</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We said earlier than the values of the first row matched only one person in the
US. Thus, this dataset does not satisfy <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map for any value of <span class="math">\(k\ge 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>How do we get a larger <span class="math">\(k\)</span>? We could generalize the first value like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">ZIP code</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">age</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">85***</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">79</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">60629</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">42</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>ZIP codes between 85000 and 85999 include the entire city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona">Phoenix</a>. There
are 36,000+ people between 75 and 84 years old in Phoenix, according to some
<a href="http://phoenix.areaconnect.com/statistics.htm">old stats</a>. It's probably safe to assume that there are more than 1,000 people
who match the quasi-identifiers values of the first row. We saw earlier that the
second row also matched 1,000+ people. So this generalized dataset satisfies
1000-map.</p>
<h1 id="attack-model-considerations">Attack model considerations</h1>
<p>Wait a second, why does this feel like cheating? What happened there, to give us
such a generous number so easily? This comes from the generous assumptions we
made in our attack model. We assumed that the attacker had <em>zero</em> information on
their target, except that they live in the US (which is implied by the presence
of ZIP codes). And with only the information (ZIP code, age), you don't need a
lot of generalization to make each row of your dataset blend in a large crowd.</p>
<p>To make this attack model stronger, you could assume that the attacker will use
a <em>smaller</em> reidentification database. For example, suppose that your genetic
disease you're studying requires regular hospital check-ups. The attacker could
restrict their search only to people who have visited a hospital in the last
year. The number of possible "suspects" for each value tuple gets smaller, so
the <span class="math">\(k\)</span> of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map decreases too<sup id="fnref:generic"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:generic">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map is inherently a <em>weak</em> model. So when choosing the quasi-identifiers and
reidentification dataset, you have to think hard at what an attacker could do.
If your attacker doesn't have lots of resources, it can be reasonable to assume
that they won't get more data than, say, the voter files from your state. But if
they can figure out more about your users, and you don't really know which
reidentification dataset they could use, maybe <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity is a safer
bet<sup id="fnref:safer"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:safer">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h1 id="and-now-some-practice">And now, some practice</h1>
<p>OK, enough theory. Let's learn how to compute <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map in practice, and anonymize
your datasets to make them verify the definition!</p>
<p>… There's one slight problem, though.</p>
<p>It's usually impossible.</p>
<p>Choosing the reidentification dataset is already a difficult exercise. Maybe you
can afford to make generous assumptions, and assume the attacker doesn't know
much. At best, you think, they'll buy voter files, or a commercial database,
which contains everyone in your state, or in the US. But… then what?</p>
<p>To compute the maximum <span class="math">\(k\)</span> such as your dataset verifies <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map, you would
first need to get the reidentification dataset yourself. But commercial
databases are expensive. Voter files might not be legal for you to obtain (even
though an evil attacker could break the law to get them).</p>
<p>So, most of the time, you can't actually check whether your data satisfies
<span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map. If it's impossible to check, it's also impossible to know exactly which
strategy to adopt to make your dataset verify the definition.</p>
<h4 id="exception-1-secret-sample">Exception 1: secret sample</h4>
<p>Suppose you're not releasing all your data, but only a <em>subset</em> (or <em>sample</em>) of
a bigger dataset that you own. Then, you can compute the <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map value of the
sample with regard to the original, bigger dataset. In this case, choosing
<span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map over <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity is relatively safe.</p>
<p>Indeed, your original dataset is certainly <em>smaller</em> than the reidentification
dataset used by the attacker. Using the same argument as above, this means that
you will obtain a <em>lower bound</em> on the value of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. Essentially, you're being
pessimistic, which means that you're on the safe side.</p>
<p>Even if the attacker has access to the original dataset, they won't know which
records are in the sample. So if the original dataset is secret, or if you've
chosen the sample in a secret way, <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map is a reasonable definition to use,
and you can compute a pessimistic approximation of it.</p>
<h4 id="exception-2-representative-distribution">Exception 2: representative distribution</h4>
<p>This case is slightly different. Suppose that you can make the assumption that
your data is a <a href="http://arx.deidentifier.org/anonymization-tool/configuration/#a27"><em>representative</em></a> (or <em>unbiaised</em>) sample of a larger
dataset. This might be a good approximation if you selected people (uniformly)
at random to build your dataset, or if it was gathered by a polling
organization.</p>
<p>In this case, you can compute an estimate of the <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map value for your data,
even without the reidentification dataset. The statistical properties which
enable this, and the methods you can use, are pretty complicated: I won't
explain them in detail here. They are mentioned and compared in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528029/">this
paper</a>, which has references to the original versions of each of them.</p>
<h4 id="exception-3-using-humans">Exception 3: using humans</h4>
<p>For the case of our doctor earlier, if the dataset is small enough, a motivated
data owner could actually do the job of an attacker "by hand". Go through each
record, and try to map it to a real person, or estimate the chances of it being
possible. We pretty much did that in this article!</p>
<p>This is very approximative, and obviously not scalable. But for our imaginary
doctor, it might be a reasonable solution!</p>
<h4 id="implementations">Implementations</h4>
<p><a href="http://arx.deidentifier.org/">ARX</a> implements the methods from exceptions 1 and 2. Documentation for the
first one can be found <a href="http://arx.deidentifier.org/anonymization-tool/configuration/#a27">here</a>. Instructions to estimate the number of
<em>unique</em> values assuming uniformity can be found <a href="http://arx.deidentifier.org/anonymization-tool/risk-analysis/#a56">here</a>. Originally,
<a href="http://neon.vb.cbs.nl/casc/..%5Ccasc%5Cmu.htm">μ-ARGUS</a> was the first software with this feature, but I couldn't run
it on my machine, so I can't say much about it.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>You might wonder why I wrote an entire article on a definition that is hardly
used because of how impractical it is. In addition to the unique problems that
we talked about in this article, the limitations of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity also apply.
It's difficult to choose <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, non-trivial to pick the quasi-identifiers, and
even trickier to model the reidentification database.</p>
<p>The definition also didn't get a lot of attention from academics. Historically,
<span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity came first<sup id="fnref:history"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:history">4</a></sup>. Then, people showed that <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity was
sometimes not sufficient to protect sensitive data, and tried to find <em>stronger</em>
definitions to fix it. Weaker definitions were, of course, less interesting.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I find that it's an interesting relaxation of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-anonymity. It
shows one of its implicit assumptions: the attacker knows that their target
belongs to the dataset. This assumption is sometimes too pessimistic: it might
be worth considering alternate definitions.</p>
<p>Choosing a privacy model is all about modeling the attacker correctly. Learning
to question implicit assumptions can only help!</p>
<div class="footnote">

<ol>
<li id="fn:generic">
<p>There is a generic version of this argument. Let's call your
  database <span class="math">\(D\)</span>, and suppose <span class="math">\(R\)</span> and <span class="math">\(R^\prime\)</span> are two possible reidentification
  databases. Suppose that <span class="math">\(R^\prime\)</span> is "larger" than <span class="math">\(R\)</span> (each element of <span class="math">\(R\)</span>
  appears in <span class="math">\(R^\prime\)</span>). Then if <span class="math">\(D\)</span> satisfies <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-map with regard to <span class="math">\(R\)</span>, it

<p>One simple consequence of the previous footnote is that if a dataset

<li id="fn:assumption">
<p>I didn't say this explicitly, but the reidentification dataset is
  always assumed to contain all rows from your dataset. It's usually not the
