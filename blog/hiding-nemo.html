    <p><strong>Do</strong> you need to share or publish sensitive data, but are hindered by
compliance or privacy barriers? Are you considering using anonymization or
synthetic data technology, but unsure how to quantify its real-world risk? Do
you want to understand more about privacy-enhancing technology to inform your
data strategy and roadmap?</p>
<p>I can help! And I can do so much more directly than ever before. Because today,
I'm launching <a href="https://hiding-nemo.com"><strong>Hiding Nemo</strong></a>, an independent consultancy focused on
helping organizations do more with data in a safe, compliant, and deeply
respectful way.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://hiding-nemo.com">website</a> for more information, keep reading this blog post
for more context about this move, or drop everything and <a href="mailto:EMAILGOESHERE">send me an
email</a> to tell me about your use case and find some time to
discuss!</p>
<h1 id="why-me">Why me?</h1>
<p>I have extensive experience with privacy-enhancing technology. I built <a href="https://github.com/opendp/tumult-analytics">software
platforms</a> and end-to-end solutions, designed anonymization strategies for
<a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/">privacy-critical projects</a>, trained hundreds of engineers and
decision-makers, reviewed product launches, wrote technical policies, and more.
I worked with large companies and small startups, delivered talks to engineers
and regulators, written <a href="https://petsymposium.org/student-paper-award.php">award-winning scientific papers</a> and
widely-praised <a href="/dp-blog">introductory material</a>.</p>
<p>Besides these credentials, I'm also known for being rigorous and honest. If I
tell you that I can solve your use case, you can expect solid work that will
stand the test of time, and that you will be able to defend to stakeholders and
data protection regulators. If there are fundamental trade-offs that limit what
I can do, or challenges that might put your project at risk, I will be open
about them and help you make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Finally, throughout my career, I've always strived to help others gain expertise
and confidence. I excel at breaking down complicated topics and helping people
understand nuanced trade-offs. So hiring me is also an investment in upskilling
your team: if I collaborate with you and your colleagues, you can expect to
learn along the way and gain the ability to tackle similar problems in the
future with less outside help.</p>
<h1 id="why-consulting">Why consulting?</h1>
<p>The primary goal of my career so far has been helping organizations ship
technology that deeply respects the people impacted by it. A lot of my efforts
towards this goal were indirect: designing and building privacy software,
training privacy reviewers, writing technical policies‚Ä¶ But there's always been
a special place in my heart for opportunities to directly influence specific
projects.</p>
<p>I thought about creating a product business. In a way, doing so is more
ambitious. Make something brand new! Raise money! Hire people! Aim for
exponential growth! But pitching a vision and building a product skews one's
perspective. It makes it incredibly tempting to think: what problems can I solve
with this? This is, of course, the wrong question. It's much better to look at
it from the opposite angle: what are the most important problems in my field,
and how can I best address them?</p>
<p>I want to find the answer to this question with a fresh eye and an open mind.
What do organizations actually need, when it comes to privacy risk analysis and
privacy-safe data sharing? I want to want to see what use cases are most
important, then address them thoroughly, bringing tangible societal benefits and
compelling returns on investment. I hope that consulting will bring both
flexibility and variety in what projects I can take on, and I can't wait to
learn from this diversity.</p>
<p>Maybe, at some point, I'll get convinced that some of these problems can be
solved in a repeatable, scalable way, and want to work on a product again. We'll
see!</p>
<h1 id="why-now">Why now?</h1>
<p>Launching a consulting business requires believing in two hypotheses: there's a
demand for this kind of service, and I'm the right person to address it. In both
cases, the timing feels right.</p>
<p>Most data protection consultancies on the market today focus on the legal side
of things. Few, if any, specialize in privacy-enhancing technology. But even law
professionals agree that to develop a solid compliance posture and get ahead of
future regulations, investing in privacy technology is key! I'm betting that it
translates to a need for independent expertise in the field, without ties to any
one product.</p>
<p>The time feels right for me as well. I have a decent professional network, a
little bit of name recognition, savings in case it doesn't go well‚Ä¶ and I enjoy
doing some things that are good for personal marketing, like giving talks and
writing blog posts. I certainly have a million things to learn about running a
business, but it seems like a good starting point!</p>
<h1 id="why-not-ai">Why not AI?</h1>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>I was told that starting a business in 2025 and <em>not</em> putting AI front and
center in its marketing was apparently a little‚Ä¶ <em>quaint</em>. I could certainly
have tried to jump on the bandwagon. I understand the basics of neural nets and
LLMs; I also have a solid grasp on their <a href="privacy-in-ai.html">privacy implications</a>. But
that's precisely why I'm not going for that angle. I know too much to try and
sell you a "privacy-safe chatbot". I care too much about the impact of my work
to build fancy AI tools that look magic but fail to actually improve your
business.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong: I'm happy to put my expertise and rigor at your service if
need some help and clarity for a use case involving privacy and AI. I can walk
you through the complicated, nuanced issues that arise when deploying AI around
sensitive data. I can help you understand the fundamental trade-offs, evaluate
potential vendors, generally see through the marketing nonsense, and recommend
great people if you need additional help. If that's what you're looking for,
<a href="mailto:EMAILGOESHERE">hit me up</a>!</p>
<p>I'm also betting that even though the whole industry is very distracted by the
new and shiny thing, there's still space for technology that <em>consistently</em>
solves real problems. Organizations still need to share or publish <em>trustworthy</em>
insights from sensitive data. And they need to make business decisions based on
<em>reliable</em> expert advice. AI can do very impressive things, but it can't do
consistent, trustworthy, nor reliable. And I can!</p>
