    <p><strong>I</strong> do not provide free work for closed-access scientific venues.</p>
<p>By "free work", I mean peer review or organizational work, like participating in
program committees. By "closed-access", I mean "which retains exclusive rights
on papers, and in particular prevents authors from publishing them under a
license like <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>".</p>
<p>Now, a few answers to frequently asked questions. </p>
<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>My time, like yours, is precious. If I work on something without being paid for
it, it's because I believe that it is somehow beneficial to the world.
Scientific venues that do not allow authors to publish their work for free, and
forbid others to reuse and republish it, do not meet this requirement.
Scientific knowledge is meant to be universally accessible, well-organized and
useful. Barriers, especially financial ones, impede scholarly work and
discriminate against underfunded researchers and institutions.</p>
<p>Some closed-access venues definitely do some valuable things, e.g., bringing
scientific minds together and providing organizational work.  But scientific
papers are the results of work done entirely by researchers. There is absolutely
no reason why they should be owned by a third party. If closed-access venues
shut down all at once tomorrow; the scientific community would quickly adapt,
and the change would overall be extremely positive.</p>
<p>Scientific venues are gradually moving towards open access, but this is taking
place very slowly. I wish to accelerate the process, and I think it is past the
point where it makes any sense to encourage the old model.</p>
<h1 id="what-about-submitting-papers">What about submitting papers?</h1>
<p>I try not to publish in closed-access venues. However, I do not make this a
matter of absolute personal policy, like for reviewing, for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, I cannot take that decision entirely on my own. Scientific papers are
typically collaborations. My coauthors should have a say in where we publish.
This is particularly important since the stakes can be much higher for them than
for me. I do not want to pursue a purely academic career, so publishing in a
less prestigious venue does not cost me much. My coauthors might feel very
differently, and I respect that.</p>
<p>Second, publishing a paper in a prestigious venue is not exactly free work. I'm
personally getting a lot out of the deal: recognition, personal gratification,
visibility of my work… This is very much in contrast to peer reviewing or
organizational work, which researchers are doing because they feel a moral
obligation to do so.</p>
<h1 id="what-about-the-reciprocity-rule">What about the reciprocity rule?</h1>
<p>Researchers do free work because they know how important it is for the
scientific community. The peer review process is crucial to publishing good
science, and the organizing work behind conferences and journals is extremely
valuable to researchers. So, if you publish scientific papers that are reviewed
by your peers, you should also review papers.</p>
<p>I understand the importance of this rule, but I choose to do my share of peer
reviewing in open access venues. This way, I not only contribute to my field of
research, but I also encourage a better, more equitable and accessible
publishing system.</p>
<p>Many people interpret the reciprocity rule <a href="https://twitter.com/TedOnPrivacy/status/1078071360256122880">differently</a>, and think that
researchers should review where they publish. I respectfully disagree, but I
acknowledge that my position might seem ethically problematic if you feel this
way. I think that the ethical problems of closed-access scientific publishing
far outweigh these concerns.</p>
<h1 id="what-about-gray-areas-like">What about gray areas, like…</h1>
<h4 id="postprints">… postprints?</h4>
<p>The only difference between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprint">postprint</a> and the final published version is
typically minor editing work, if any. I consider this distinction negligible.
Thus, it's fine if the postprint can be published in open access, even if the
publisher's version cannot.</p>
<h4 id="preprints">… preprints?</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint">preprint</a> version of a paper is essentially a draft. Once a paper has been
improved after incorporating the comments of peer reviewers, all preprints
published online should be replaced by the improved version.</p>
<p>Allowing preprints but not postprints to be published in open access encourages
people to read the preprint, when a better version exists. In the worst case,
the draft version contains factual errors that were fixed during peer review.
Not replacing the preprint by the postprint is counterproductive, and completely
nonsensical. The people providing reviewing work did so for free, and the result
of their work should not be owned by a third party. If only preprints can be
published in open access, then I do not consider the venue as open access.</p>
<h4 id="papers-accessible-online-but-not-under-a-permissive-license">… papers accessible online, but not under a permissive license?</h4>
<p>Some publishers will tell you that they will make your paper freely accessible
online through some portal, but will still forbid you to publish it elsewhere
under a permissive license. These promises are worthless — if publishers lie or
impose ridiculous conditions before giving people access to your papers, what
are you going to do? Sue them? Anyway, the fundamental problem is that
publishers should not own rights over scientific papers. They should not be able
to hinder the dissemination of knowledge they did not create. I do not consider
venues of these publishers to be open access.</p>
<h4 id="author-fees-for-open-access">… author fees for open access?</h4>
<p>Some conferences allow authors to pay an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_processing_charge">additional fee</a> for their work to
be published in open access. Some fees are reasonable, on the order of 100€ or
less, but when big publishers use this model, these fees are generally much
higher: <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess">≈&dollar;1000 for ACM</a>, <a href="https://open.ieee.org/index.php/for-authors/article-processing-charges/">≈&dollar;2000 for IEEE</a>, and up to
an eye-popping <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/pricing">≈&dollar;6000 for Elsevier</a>. Needless to say, such
high fees are absolutely ridiculous compared to the actual costs to the
publisher.</p>
<p>Small fees might be acceptable, especially if they are mandatory and are only
there to recoup publisher costs. Larger fees, however, creates a system that is
unfair to researchers that cannot pay, and actively encourages them <em>not</em> to
make their research available in open access. It also takes financial resources
out of valuable research projects, and gives it to publishers instead, which are
providing a comparatively negligible value. If this is the only way that a venue
allows authors to publish their own papers, I do not consider it open access.</p>
<h4 id="embargo-periods">… embargo periods?</h4>
<p>This refers to a model where authors have to wait <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embargo_(academic_publishing)">a certain time</a> before
publishing their own papers on open repositories. Before this delay, the paper
is only available behind paywalls or subscriptions. Again, it is unfair to
students and researchers that are not well-funded, and is an artificial and
arbitrary barrier to the dissemination of scientific knowledge. To me, venues
which operate under this model are not open access.</p>
<h4 id="nonprofit-organizations">… nonprofit organizations?</h4>
<p>Some organizations earn money via copyrighted academic papers, and are doing
good scientific things with this money. I understand how it came to be, but I
still think that blocking access to scientific knowledge is not an acceptable
way to fund such programs. We, as a society, should absolutely fund scholarly
institutions and education programs. But we should do so via other means. </p>
<p>I agree that there are significant ethical differences between for-profit
scientific publishers and nonprofit scholarly institutions. But a closed-access
venue will not get my support simply because it is organized by a nonprofit.</p>
<h4 id="books-or-other-works-that-need-heavy-editing">… books, or other works that need heavy editing?</h4>
<p>Paid editing work is either nonexistent or useless for scientific conferences
and journals. But the situation is very different for books or monographs, most
of which require professional editing before publication. This work should be
compensated, and copyright is one way of achieving this. I do not know this
space well. By default, my personal policy does not apply there.</p>
<h4 id="other-types-of-free-scientific-work">… other types of free scientific work?</h4>
<p>Some other types of free work are not explicitly covered by this policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>As I already mentioned, publishing my own papers is not free work. Similarly,
  giving a talk at a conference is not necessarily free work either. It depends
  on the message, the audience, whether expenses are reimbursed…</li>
<li>Course materials, and other physical artifacts from education and mentoring
  efforts, should in principle also be freely accessible. But I could imagine
  that in some cases, benefits that come from these efforts might outweigh the
  ethical issues that I have with closed-access publishing.</li>
<li>There are certain types of work that I simply do not know enough to have an
  opinion about: reviewing grant proposals, participating in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_organization">technical
  standards organizations</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all those examples, I decide what I do on a case-by-case basis rather than
applying a blanket policy.</p>
<h1 id="why-are-you-publishing-this">Why are you publishing this?</h1>
<p>First, I want to draw a line in the sand for myself, and taking a public stance
is an excellent way to do so. Second, I hope to start a discussion, and maybe
get other people to consider adopting a similar policy.</p>
<p>If everyone stopped reviewing for closed-access venues, the entire scientific
publishing model would change for the better overnight. Refusing to do free work
will likely not hurt your career significantly, especially if you do not take a
public position like I do.</p>
<h1 id="why-arent-you-going-further">Why aren't you going further?</h1>
<p>My standards are relatively low: allowing authors to retain rights to their own
papers should really be the absolute minimum. I think that journals and
conferences should do more. For example, they should automatically publish all
papers under a permissive license like <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a>, rather than simply
allowing authors to do so.</p>
<p>I do not feel as strongly about this. For now, I'm okay with providing free work
to venues which simply say "sure, feel free to put your papers under a
permissive license yourself". It's good enough, and in some cases, it's the best
compromise that program committees for major conferences could negotiate with
publishers. I might reconsider this in the future.</p>
<h1 id="why-are-you-so-judgmental">Why are you so judgmental?</h1>
<p>I hope I did not come across this way, but in case I did, I want to make the
following explicit. I absolutely understand that you might not make the same
choices than I do. I do not think badly of anyone choosing to do otherwise. Part
of why I can afford to have this stance is because it is not costing me much. It
is not my place to judge what other people should be doing, especially people
who would be more personally impacted by such choices.</p>
<p>I do hope that more people try to accelerate the switch to open access. Tenured
professors have more freedom to refuse to encourage closed-access conferences,
even if these conferences are the most prestigious. People in positions of power
within closed-access venues might lobby to change publishing policies. I think
that they should, but I'm not in their shoes. To them, other things might seem
more important or urgent to work on. It is about values, and it is not my place
to tell you what your values should be. </p>
<h1 id="is-this-type-of-personal-stance-really-the-best-way-towards-open-access">Is this type of personal stance really the best way towards open access?</h1>
<p>No. The best way is through funding agencies. They should mandate that all
papers published using their grants must be published in open access. Laws
should automatically give researchers the right to do so without fear of
retaliation from publishers, no matter what the copyright agreement says. Some
countries are already doing that. It is great, and should be generalized
globally. These top-down mandates are the best path towards a world where 100%
of scientific papers are published under an open access license. They have much
more impact than personal policies like mine.</p>
<p>Also, if I already had some power within publishing institutions, I might try to
accomplish change from the inside instead. This might be the most efficient path
for someone already there. I am not in that position, though, and probably will
not be in the near future. So, I am doing what I can, at my level.</p>
<h1 id="can-i-try-to-change-your-mind">Can I try to change your mind?</h1>
<p>Sure. My contact info is at the bottom of the page. Note that I have already
heard the following points, and taken them under consideration.</p>
<ul>
<li>"You're going to make some people angry and possibly hurt your career."</li>
<li>"For-profit publishers are useful, here's a long list of valuable things they
  do."</li>
<li>"It is unethical to publish in a venue but refuse to peer review for it."</li>
<li>"Publishers generally don't bother you when you upload your papers on your
  personal website, so there's no pragmatic reason to care about these things."</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to try and convince me that I'm doing something wrong, I encourage
you to bring new ideas to the discussion.</p>
<hr>
<p><small>Note: none of these ideas is originally from me. I wrote this after being
inspired by friends and colleagues who also chose not to support closed-access
venues with free work. I'm not reproducing names for privacy reasons (not
everyone is comfortable with taking a public stance), but most of the credit
goes to them.</small></p>
