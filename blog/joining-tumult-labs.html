    <p><strong>I'm</strong> joining <a href="https://www.tmlt.io">Tumult Labs</a>, a startup focused on making
<a href="differential-privacy-awesomeness.html">differential privacy</a> ubiquitous. I'm incredibly excited about taking DP to
the next stage, and I think Tumult Labs is a fantastic place to do that. Let me
tell you why!</p>
<h1 id="why-differential-privacy">Why differential privacy?</h1>
<p><a href="differential-privacy-awesomeness.html">Differential privacy</a> (DP) makes it possible to safely publish statistics
about sensitive data. Today, using DP in practice isn't very easy, but potential
applications are everywhere. I'm hopeful that by making this tech more usable
and more useful, we can make progress on three fronts.</p>
<h4 id="making-existing-practices-safer">Making existing practices safer</h4>
<p>Today, many organizations compute statistics about people, and share it with
third parties. Government agencies publish information about their citizens.
Online platforms give content creators data about their audience. Hospitals
share patient data with researchers. And of course, a myriad of commercial
applications exist too.</p>
<p>All this data is often more revealing than people expect: anonymization is
difficult to get right, and easy to get wrong. Problems happen <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/technology/australians-health-records-unwittingly-exposed-20171218-p4yxt2.html">all</a>
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/12/why-anonymous-data-sometimes-isnt/">the</a> <a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6330850/vic-transport-data-not-anonymous-enough/">time</a>. Worse, these problems are especially harmful to
folks in <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22587248/grindr-app-location-data-outed-priest-jeffrey-burrill-pillar-data-harvesting">marginalized populations</a>. Only releasing aggregate data,
or using clever-looking mitigations, isn't enough. The US Census <a href="us-census-reconstruction-attack.html">reconstruction
attack</a> made that very clear.</p>
<p>Worse, these are only the problems we hear about. Many organizations generate
and archive statistical data, without ever sharing it with outsiders. What if
they misclassify this data as "anonymized", even though reidentification is
possible? This can have painful compliance implications, even though it might
not make headlines.</p>
<p>Differential privacy is the only tool we know that prevents these problems. The
math works: DP provides <em>provable</em> guarantees. The main obstacle to adoption is
usability. So let's work on that, and make all these practices much safer!</p>
<h4 id="enabling-new-use-cases">Enabling new use cases</h4>
<p>These existing practices are only the tip of the iceberg. How many applications
never see the light of day, for privacy and compliance reasons? Governments want
to do more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">open data</a>, but don't want to breach their constituents'
privacy. Organizations want to share data with researchers, without risking
privacy incidents. Valuable data gets deleted, even though it could have been
useful to share it with others, or archive some of it.</p>
<p>Robust and accessible anonymization tooling will enable many such use cases. It
will lower the cost of both compliance and respectful privacy practices. Today,
DP is still a shiny new concept that requires considerable investment to use:
only large organizations can afford it. In a few years, we can turn DP into a
standard industry best practice, like encryption at rest or audit trails. I
can't wait for us to get there!</p>
<h4 id="improving-incentive-structures">Improving incentive structures</h4>
<p>What happens once it gets dead simple to use provable anonymization techniques?
Enabling the use cases I mentioned before is one thing. But there might also be
rippling beneficial effects, much more impactful in the long run.</p>
<p>Here's an example. Today, large companies can see value in sharing data with
researchers. But the choice is theirs. What if they don't see the point? Or
worse, what if they're afraid of what the research might uncover? Nothing stops
them from keeping the data secret. Pushing these companies to be more
transparent about their impact is difficult: privacy can be a convenient excuse
to keep damaging information secret.</p>
<p>Once differential privacy is the new standard, and using it is easy, this excuse
goes away. It will be easier to demand openness from companies holding massive
amounts of data. This could happen, for example, through legislation. Today,
regulators who want to mandate such transparency face a difficult task: how to
do so without creating requirements that conflict with data protection
regulations? Differential privacy could change the equation.</p>
<p>And legislation isn't the only path: changing <em>cultural norms</em> can have a
massive impact as well. The easier it is to share data, the more organizations
will. Over time, the perception of what is and isn't legitimate to keep secret
will shift. And such a global shift towards openness can create a lot of
pressure!</p>
<p>So that's why I'm excited about differential privacy. Now, why do I think
Tumult Labs is a great place for making it successful?</p>
<h1 id="why-tumult-labs">Why Tumult Labs?</h1>
<p>Tumult Labs was founded by three professors, who have been working on DP for
more than a decade. They worked on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;as_epq=%22differential+privacy%22&amp;as_oq=%22ashin+machanavajjhala%22+%22michael+hay%22+%22gerome+miklau%22">foundational theory</a> <em>and</em> on DP's
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~duk17/papers/PrivacyOnTheMap.pdf">first-ever real-world deployment</a>. Now, they're advising the US
Census Bureau on some of their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10659.pdf">most complex challenges</a>.</p>
<p>Their work on real-world deployments led them to a realization I'm quite
familiar with: if we want to reach wide adoption of DP, we have to invest in
building excellent tooling. So they've been assembling a <a href="https://www.tmlt.io/company">talented
team</a> to do exactly that: build what their clients
need into a single general-purpose platform. And I was very impressed by what
they <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ashwin/pubs/Ektelo-SIGMOD2018.pdf">published</a> about this work! It shows both deep technical insight,
and a focus on building things in a modular and reusable way. I can't wait to
dig into this tech some more, and learn from the folks behind it.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm also eager to tackle the personal challenges that await. Being a
part of a small startup should be a much-needed change of pace. Helping external
clients will be new and pretty exciting. I'll also be Tumult's first employee in
Europe, but not the last: I'm thrilled about the idea of growing the team there.
