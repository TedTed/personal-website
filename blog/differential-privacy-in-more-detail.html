<p><span class='lettrine'>A</span><strong>s</strong> I mentioned in the <a href="differential-privacy-awesomeness.html">previous article</a>,
differential privacy is pretty awesome. If I did a good job, you're now
wondering what the <em>real</em> definition looks like. So in this post, I will go into
a bit more detail into what differential privacy actually means, and why it
works so well. There will be some math! But I promise I will explain all the
concepts I use, and give lots of intuition.</p>
<h1 id="the-definition">The definition</h1>
<p>We saw that a process satisfies differential privacy if its output is basically
the same if you change the data of one individual. And by "basically the same",
we meant "the probabilities are close".</p>

<p>Let's now translate that into a formal definition. <a name="definition"></a></p>
<p>A process <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-differentially private if for all databases <span class="math">\(D_1\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(D_2\)</span> which differ in only one individual:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\mathbb{P}\left[A(D_1)=O\right] \le e^\varepsilon\cdot\mathbb{P}\left[A(D_2)=O\right]
$$</div>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">… and this must be true for all
possible outputs <span class="math">\(O\)</span>. Let's unpack this.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[A(D_1)=O\right]\)</span> is the probability that when you run the process <span class="math">\(A\)</span> on
the database <span class="math">\(D_1\)</span>, the output is <span class="math">\(O\)</span>. This process is probabilistic: if you run
it several times, it might give you different answers. A typical process might
be: "count the people with blue eyes, add some random number to this count, and
return this sum". Since the random number changes every time you run the
process, the results will vary.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(e^\varepsilon\)</span> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function">exponential function</a> applied to the parameter
<span class="math">\(\varepsilon&gt;0\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is very close to 0, then <span class="math">\(e^\varepsilon\)</span> is very close
to 1, so the probabilities are very similar. The bigger <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is, the more
the probabilities can differ.</p>
<p>Of course, the definition is symmetrical: you can replace <span class="math">\(D_1\)</span> by <span class="math">\(D_2\)</span> and
vice-versa, and the two databases will still differ in only one individual. So
we could replace it by:</p>
<div class="math">$$
e^{-\varepsilon}\cdot\mathbb{P}\left[A(D_2)=O\right]
\le \mathbb{P}\left[A(D_1)=O\right] \le
e^\varepsilon\cdot\mathbb{P}\left[A(D_2)=O\right]
$$</div>
<p>Thus, this formula means that the output of the process is similar if you change
or remove the data of one person. The degree of similarity depends on
<span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>: the smaller it is, the more similar the outputs are.</p>
<p>What does this similarity have to do with privacy? First, I'll explain this with
an intuitive example. Then, I'll formalize this idea with a more generic
interpretation.</p>
<h1 id="a-simple-example-randomized-response">A simple example: randomized response <a name="rr"></a></h1>
<p>Suppose you want to do a survey to know how many people are illegal drug users.
If you naively go out and ask people whether they're using illegal drugs, many
will lie to you. So you devise the following mechanism. The participants no
longer directly answer the question "have you consumed illegal drugs in the past
week?". Instead, each of them will flip a coin, without showing it to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>On heads, the participant tells the truth (<em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em>).</li>
<li>On tails, they flip a second coin. If the second coin lands on heads, they
  answer <em>Yes</em>. Otherwise, they answer <em>No</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>How is this better for survey respondents? They can now answer <em>Yes</em> without
revealing that they're doing something illegal. When someone answers <em>Yes</em>, you
can't know their true answer for sure. They could be actually doing drugs, but
they might also have answered at random. </p>
<p>Let's compute the probabilities of each answer for a drug user.</p>
<ul>
<li>With probability 50%, they will say the truth and answer <em>Yes</em>.</li>
<li>With probability 50%, they will answer at random.<ul>
<li>They then have another 50% chance to answer <em>Yes</em>, so 25% chance in total.</li>
<li>Similarly, in total, they have a 25% chance to answer <em>No</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, we get a 75% chance to answer <em>Yes</em> and a 25% chance to answer <em>No</em>.
For someone who is not doing drugs, the probabilities are reversed: 25% chance
to answer <em>Yes</em> and 75% to answer <em>No</em>. Using the notations from earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[A(Yes)=Yes\right] = 0.75\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[A(Yes)=No\right] = 0.25\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[A(No)=Yes\right] = 0.25\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[A(No)=No\right] = 0.75\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, <span class="math">\(0.75\)</span> is three times bigger than <span class="math">\(0.25\)</span>. So if we choose <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>
such as <span class="math">\(e^\varepsilon=3\)</span> (that's <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\simeq1.1\)</span>), this process is
<span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-differentially private. So this plausible deniability translates
nicely in the language of differential privacy.</p>
<p>Of course, with a differentially private process like this one, you're getting
some noise into your data. But if you have enough answers, with high
probability, the noise will cancel itself out. Suppose you have 1000 answers in
total: 400 of them are <em>Yes</em> and 600 are <em>No</em>. About 50% of all 1000 answers are
random, so you can remove 250 answers from each count. In total, you get 150
<em>Yes</em> answers out of 500 non-random answers, so about 30% of <em>Yes</em> overall.</p>
<p>What if you want more privacy? Instead of having the participants say the truth
with probability 50%, you can have them tell the truth 25% of the time. What if
you want less noise instead, at the cost of less protection? Have them tell the
truth 75% of the time. Finding out <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> and quantifying the noise for
each option is left as an exercise for the reader =)</p>
<h1 id="a-generalization-quantifying-the-attackers-knowledge">A generalization: quantifying the attacker's knowledge</h1>
<p><a name="quantifying"></a></p>
<p>Let's forget about the previous example and consider a more generic scenario. In
line with the <a href="differential-privacy-awesomeness.html">previous article</a>, we will describe this scenario from the
<em>attacker</em>'s perspective. We have a mechanism <span class="math">\(A\)</span> which is
<span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-differentially private. We run it on some database <span class="math">\(D\)</span>, and
release the output <span class="math">\(A(D)\)</span> to an attacker. Then, the attacker tries to figure out
whether someone (their <em>target</em>) is in <span class="math">\(D\)</span>.</p>
<p>Under differential privacy, the attacker can't gain a lot of information about
their target. And this is true even if this attacker has a lot of knowledge
about the dataset. Let's take the stronger attacker we can think of: they know
<em>all the database, except their target</em>. This attacker has to determine which
database is the real one, between two options: one with their target in it
(let's call it <span class="math">\(D_{in}\)</span>), the other without (<span class="math">\(D_{out}\)</span>)<sup id="fnref:dbs"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dbs">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So, in the attacker's model of the world, the actual database <span class="math">\(D\)</span> can be either
<span class="math">\(D_{in}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(D_{out}\)</span>. They might have an <em>initial suspicion</em> that their target
is in the database. This suspicion is represented by a <em>probability</em>,
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]\)</span>. This probability can be anything between <span class="math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.
Say, <span class="math">\(0.9\)</span> if the attacker's suspicion is strong, <span class="math">\(0.01\)</span> if they think it's very
unlikely, <span class="math">\(0.5\)</span> if they have no idea… Similarly, their suspicion that their
target is <em>not</em> in the dataset is also a probability, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{out}\right]\)</span>.
Since there are only two options,
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{out}\right]=1-\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, suppose the attacker sees that the mechanism returns output <span class="math">\(O\)</span>. How much
information did the attacker gain? This is captured by looking at how much their
suspicion changed after seeing this output. In mathematical terms, we have to
compare <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]\)</span> with the updated suspicion
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\mid A(D)=O\right]\)</span>. This updated suspicion is the attacker's
model of the world after seeing <span class="math">\(O\)</span>.</p>
<p>With differential privacy, the updated probability is never too far from the
initial suspicion. And we can quantify this phenomenon exactly. For example,
with <span class="math">\(\varepsilon=1.1\)</span>, here is what the upper and lower bounds look like.</p>
<p><center>
<img alt="Graph showing the bounds on the posterior as a function of the prior" src="https://desfontain.es/blog/images/dp-bounds-graph.svg">
</center></p>
<p>The black line is what happens if the attacker didn't get their suspicion
updated at all. The blue lines are the lower and upper bounds on the updated
suspicion: it can be anywhere between the two. We can visualize the example
mentioned in the <a href="differential-privacy-awesomeness.html">previous article</a>: for an initial suspicion of 50%, the
updated suspicion is approximately between 25% and 75%.</p>
<p>How do we prove that these bounds hold? We'll need a result from probability
theory, and some basic arithmetic manipulation. I reproduced the proof as simply
as I could, but you still don't have to read it. If you want to, click here:
<button id="toggleProof"></button></p>
<div id="proof" style="display: none; border-left: double; padding-left: 10px">
<p>The proof is based on a theorem called Bayes' rule. Explaining the full
intuition behind this theorem is a bit out of scope for this post. If you want
to understand what it says and why it works, I recommend you read <a href="https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq">this
guide</a>. If you don't, just trust me: this theorem allows us to rephrase
the updated suspicion in other terms.</p>
<p>
<div class="math">$$ 
\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\mid A(D)=O\right]=\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]\cdot\mathbb{P}\left[A(D)=O\mid D=D_{in}\right]}{\mathbb{P}\left[A(D)=O\right]}
$$</div>
</p>
<p>Let's interpret each of these terms. We recognize <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]\)</span>, that's
the initial suspicion of the attacker. <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[A(D)=O\mid D=D_{in}\right]\)</span> is the
probability of getting output <span class="math">\(O\)</span> from database <span class="math">\(D_{in}\)</span>, which we can simplify
into <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[A\left(D_{in}\right)=O\right]\)</span>. Finally, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[A(D)=O\right]\)</span> is the
probability that we get the output <span class="math">\(O\)</span>, in the attacker's model of the world.</p>
<p>This last term is icky. We don't know its value. So let's make it disappear by
considering the <em>ratio</em> between the two updated probabilities
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\mid A(D)=O\right]\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{out}\mid A(D)=O\right]\)</span>. The
icky term will nicely go away:</p>
<p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\mid A(D)=O\right]}{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{out}\mid A(D)=O\right]} =
\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]}{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{out}\right]}
    \cdot\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[A\left(D_{in}\right)=O\right]}{\mathbb{P}\left[A\left(D_{out}\right)=O\right]}
$$</div>
</p>
<p>Note that this isn't a meaningless math trick. This ratio of probabilities
actually has a simple interpretation: it's what gamblers call <em>betting odds</em>.
For example, on betting websites, the odds for the France v. Croatia game in the
2018 World Cup were 2:1. This means that according to bookies, the probability
for France to win was twice as much as for Croatia. This corresponds to
probabilities of about 67% and 33%, respectively.</p>
<p>Anyway, look! The two terms <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[A\left(D_{in}\right)=O\right]\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[A\left(D_{out}\right)=O\right]\)</span> are the ones from the differential privacy
definition. So we know that their ratio is bounded:</p>
<p>
<div class="math">$$
e^{-\varepsilon} \le
\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[A\left(D_{in}\right)=O\right]}{\mathbb{P}\left[A\left(D_{out}\right)=O\right]}
\le e^\varepsilon
$$</div>
</p>
<p>If we plug this into the previous formula, we get a nice relation:</p>
<p>
<div class="math">$$
e^{-\varepsilon}\cdot\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]}{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{out}\right]} \le
\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\mid A(D)=O\right]}{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{out}\mid A(D)=O\right]} \le
e^\varepsilon\cdot\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]}{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{out}\right]}
$$</div>
</p>
<p>This relation is a reformulation of differential privacy. The original
definition said that the probability distributions of outputs are similar. This
relation says that the <em>odds</em> don't change too much after looking at the output.
And the two formulations are equivalent: you could write the same proof in the
other direction.</p>
<p>But back to our proof. All we need to do now is replace <span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{out}\right]\)</span>
with <span class="math">\(1-\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]\)</span>, do the same for
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{out}\mid A\left(D\right)=O\right]\)</span>, and solve for
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\mid A\left(D\right)=O\right]\)</span>. You end up with the
following bounds:</p>
<p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]}{e^{\varepsilon}+\left(1-e^{\varepsilon}\right)\cdot\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]}
\leq \mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\mid A\left(D\right)=O\right] \leq
\frac{e^{\varepsilon}\cdot\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]}{1+\left(e^{\varepsilon}-1\right)\cdot\mathbb{P}\left[D=D_{in}\right]}
$$</div>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">which you can plot using your favorite software.</p>
</div>
<p>What does this look like for various values of <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>? We can draw a
generalization of this graph with pretty colors:</p>
<p><center>
<img alt="Graph showing the bounds on the posterior as a function of the prior for many values of ε" src="https://desfontain.es/blog/images/dp-contour-graph.png">
</center></p>
<p>For larger values of <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>, this gets scary quite fast. Let's say you're
using <span class="math">\(\varepsilon=5\)</span>. Then, an attacker can go from a small suspicion (say,
10%) to a very high degree of certainty (94%).</p>
<h1 id="what-about-composition">What about composition? <a name="composition"></a></h1>
<p>In the previous section, I formalized two claims I made in my <a href="differential-privacy-awesomeness.html">last article</a>.
First, I explained what it means to <em>quantify</em> information gain. Furthermore, I
picked an attacker with <em>full background knowledge</em>. If the attacker knows less
information in the first place, the bounds we showed still hold.</p>
<p>What about the third claim? I said that differential privacy was <em>composable</em>.
Suppose that two algorithms <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-differentially
private. We want to prove that publishing the result of both is
<span class="math">\(2\varepsilon\)</span>-differentially private. Let's call <span class="math">\(C\)</span> the algorithm which
combines <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>: <span class="math">\(C(D)=\left(A(D),B(D)\right)\)</span>. The output of this
algorithm will be a pair of outputs: <span class="math">\(O=\left(O_A,O_B\right)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The insight is that the two algorithms are <em>independent</em>. They each have their
own randomness, so the result of one does not impact the result of the other.
This allows us to simply write:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left[C\left(D_{1}\right)=O\right] &amp; =\mathbb{P}\left[A\left(D_{1}\right)=O_{A}\right]\cdot\mathbb{P}\left[B\left(D_{1}\right)=O_{B}\right]\\
 &amp; \leq e^{2\varepsilon}\cdot\mathbb{P}\left[A\left(D_{2}\right)=O_{A}\right]\cdot\mathbb{P}\left[B\left(D_{2}\right)=O_{B}\right]\\
 &amp; \leq e^{2\varepsilon}\cdot\mathbb{P}\left[C\left(D_{2}\right)=O\right]
\end{align*}
$$</div>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">so <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is <span class="math">\(2\varepsilon\)</span>-differentially
private.</p>
<h1 id="future-steps">Future steps</h1>
<p>I hope that I convinced you that differential privacy can be an excellent way to
protect your data (if your <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is low). Now, if everything is going
according to my master plan, you should be like… "This is awesome! I want to use
it everywhere! How do I do that?"</p>
