    <p><strong>Earlier this month</strong>, there was lots of chatter online about the new iPhone's
FaceID feature: it allows you to unlock your device just by looking at it.
Behind the scenes are some hardware and algorithms which create a 3D map of your
face, and determine whether you're the phone's rightful owner.</p>
<p>Many people seemed to not understand the difference between <em>authentication</em> and
<em>identification</em>. Both authentication and identification can use biometric data,
like facial recognition. Nonetheless, these use cases are fundamentally
different. I'll try to explain why — I hope this can enlighten the debate around
features like this a little bit.</p>
<h1 id="authentication">Authentication</h1>
<p>Authentication is what you do when you log in to some Internet service, or when
you unlock your phone. First, you <em>announce your identity</em> to the authentication
system (e.g. a log-in page or lock screen). Then, you try to <em>prove</em> to the
system that you're indeed who you pretend to be. For an Internet service,
identity can mean your e-mail address. For a phone, it's more implicit: you're
trying to prove you're the owner of the phone.</p>
<p>The attack model is the following: some evil person <em>pretends to be you</em>, and
tries to prove it to the authentication system to get access to your data. This
attacker can be of various types:</p>
<ul>
<li>an abusive partner who wants to look into your phone,</li>
<li>a scammer who wants to steal your identity,</li>
<li>a spy who wants to penetrate a company's network…</li>
</ul>
<p>Fundamentally, authentication protects against <em>unauthorized access to data</em>.</p>
<h1 id="identification">Identification</h1>
<p>Identification is trying to figure out <em>who someone is</em> based on some
characteristics they have, or data they produced. It's what the police does when
running a fingerprint against a database of suspects. It's what privacy
researchers do when they try to show that a data release has not been <a href="k-anonymity.html">properly
anonymized</a>.</p>
<p>The attack model here is that somebody tries to <em>find your identity</em>. To
succeed, an attacker needs to have a <em>list of suspects</em>, and enough information
to <em>distinguish</em> who you are among all possibilities.</p>
<h1 id="good-authentication-vector-vs-good-identification-vector">Good authentication vector vs. good identification vector</h1>
<p>From these different attack models, a first distinction emerges.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a piece of data is <em>secret</em>, it will work well as an authentication vector.
  Passwords, codes embedded in security keys, or one-time SMS codes, are classic
  examples.</li>
<li>If a piece of data is <em>public</em>, or at least known to the attacker, it can work
  as an identification vector. Names, dates of birth or phone numbers are good
  candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p>A second distinction is on the <em>amount</em> of information present in the data.</p>
<ul>
<li>To authenticate someone, you don't always need lots of info. For example, a
  4-digit PIN code is enough to get a decent security on a phone, provided only
  a few retries are allowed.</li>
<li>To identify someone, you need more than this. Even if you somehow get your
  hands on a database which contains everyone's PIN code, each one would
  correspond to many people. A PIN code alone wouldn't be enough: you need some
  context or more data to reliably identify someone. <br><br></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="biometrics-for-authentication">Biometrics for authentication</h1>
<p>Biometrics seem to be blurring the line. Fingerprints are not exactly secret,
right? Your face is probably also all over social media. So how come they are
more and more used as authentication methods?</p>
<p>It turns out that the <em>secretness</em> of authentication data is not a required
property. All we need is <em>unforgeability</em>: an attacker must not be able to
impersonate you. If a secret is well-protected, it's difficult to falsify: the
attacker can't imitate what they don't know. But biometric info can be quite
unforgeable, even if it's not technically secret. It's easy to find what
someone's face or fingerprint looks like, but it's hard to create a fake version
of it.</p>
<p>Some folks have written excellent articles on the difficulty of bypassing
biometric authentication. So, instead of diving into the details, I'll simply
recommend <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/face-id-touch-id-pins-no-id-and-pragmatic-security/">this excellent
post</a>
from Troy Hunt's blog.</p>

<h1 id="biometrics-for-identification">Biometrics for identification</h1>
<p>Information being <em>public</em> doesn't mean that there exists a central database
containing everyone's data. This is especially true for biometric info. Most
attackers don't have access to global fingerprint or facial recognition
databases (yet)… But when they do, it definitely raises serious privacy
concerns. </p>
<p>Classic identification attacks focus on finding the person behind a pseudonym or
identifier. Identifiers can be phone numbers, e-mail addresses… Over time, you
can change pseudonyms and identifiers<sup id="fnref:changed"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:changed">1</a></sup>. You can also maintain separate
identities, for example when you use a different email address for services you
don't trust.</p>
<p>Biometric identification doesn't have these nice properties. You can't change
your face or your fingerprints! And you can't use a different right thumb with
border agents of different countries, either.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you also have less <em>control</em> over your biometric information. You
can decide not to interact with a given online service if you don't trust it.
But if you're living a "normal" life in a Western city, your face will most
certainly be caught and recorded by many surveillance cameras.</p>
<p>Creating a facial recognition database is becoming simpler and cheaper. In
Russia, pro-Putin activists identified anti-government protestors using pictures
gathered from social media<sup id="fnref:findface"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:findface">2</a></sup>. "Researchers" are creating algorithms to
detect sexual orientation<sup id="fnref:orientation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:orientation">3</a></sup> or gender identity<sup id="fnref:gender"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gender">4</a></sup>. They used
data from dating apps or video sharing services, and didn't ask anyone for
consent.</p>
<p>Using biometric data for identification is not inherently problematic. For
example, it helps catching violent criminals. Yet, the privacy concerns are most
definitely justified.</p>
<h1 id="are-those-really-distinct-problems">Are those really distinct problems?</h1>
<p>So, biometric identification is creepy, but biometric authentication isn't
always problematic. But wait. If people build biometric authentication systems…
How do they recognize someone's face or fingerprint if they don't store it
somewhere? Didn't the engineers behind FaceID had to build a biometric database?
Couldn't evil people use this for identification? </p>
<p>Not necessarily. For many of those tools, it is a specific design goal to <em>not</em>
make biometric identification easier. This is achieved through a series of risk
mitigation mechanisms<sup id="fnref:faceid"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:faceid">5</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The biometric data exists only on the user's phone, not in a central place.
  The phone vendor doesn't need to unlock your phone! So it doesn't need this
  information. The database doesn't exist in the first place.</li>
<li>The data lives in a specific piece of hardware called "Secure Enclave". This
  chip encrypts and stores secrets <em>independently</em> of other parts of the phone.
  Even if a hacker takes control of your phone, or a thief steals it, they can't
  read the biometric data stored on it. Building a biometric database from
  hacked iPhones is near-impossible.</li>
<li>Pictures taken during authentication are immediately discarded. Only the
  pictures used for <em>enrollment</em> (when you set up FaceID) are stored. This way,
  you know what is stored on your phone. This way, the chip doesn't store
  pictures that you wouldn't want stored there.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, some fingerprint systems store only <em>partial</em> information on their
users. Remember how a 4-digit PIN was enough for certain authentication systems?
Similarly, partial biometric data can be enough to be a good authentication
vector. So even if data leaks, the exact info might not be enough to uniquely
identify someone.</p>
<p>Authentication is a <em>different problem</em> than identification. Thus, a system
designed for the former can also mitigate risk against the latter.</p>
<p>Does this mean we shouldn't worry about biometric authentication systems? Ha!
No.</p>
<h4 id="point-of-failure-1-the-tech">Point of failure 1: the tech</h4>
<p>I'm quite confident that Apple's new FaceID system is reasonably secure.
Zero-days vulnerabilities for iOS are worth
<a href="https://www.zerodium.com/program.html">millions</a>. That's a good sign that Apple
has a strong security team who know what they're doing.</p>
<p>But there should be a <em>lot</em> of healthy skepticism when anyone introduces a new
system like this. Data breaches happen all the time. If a biometric
authentication system is badly designed, the potential consequences are
catastrophic.</p>
<h4 id="point-of-failure-2-the-people">Point of failure 2: the people</h4>
<p>Did I convince you that authentication and identification are not the same
thing? Excellent. Will most people understand the distinction? I'm not exactly
optimistic =(</p>
<p>FaceID will probably make people more comfortable with facial recognition
itself. And if the technology gets normalized, this will lead to more
problematic uses being more easily accepted.</p>
<p>This week, I heard about future plans for the London public transportation
system. They are considering <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/train-station-face-recognition-gateless-gate-technology">facial recognition</a> as a replacement for
magnetic cards containing tickets. Have your face recognized when you enter and
leave the subway, get charged later. This is an <em>identification</em> system. The
privacy implications are vastly different, and the consequences of security
incidents could be catastrophic.</p>
<p>Will people understand the difference?</p>
