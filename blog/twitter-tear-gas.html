    <p><strong>I recently finished</strong> reading <em>Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility
of Networked Protest</em>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeynep_Tufekci">Zeynep Tufekci</a>. It's a long yet dense essay
on how modern protests work, and why they sometimes don't. Tufekci has a long
experience as an activist in many different protests around the world. She also
has a strong education in technology and in social sciences, and her work
focuses on the intersection between the two. In short, she is the perfect person
to write a book conceptualizing modern protests and their use of technology.
Unsurprisingly, the essay makes for a fascinating and enlightening read.</p>
<p><center>
<a href="https://www.twitterandteargas.org/"><img alt="Twitter and Tear Gas cover" src="https://desfontain.es/blog/images/twitter-tear-gas.png"></a>
</center></p>
<p>Here's an example. What does it mean when many people march in the streets? It
displays power: the power to send the word out, to convince people to join, to
organize logistics. But the <em>actual march</em> isn't scary to people in power: the
<em>implications</em> are. If an organization is able to gather many people for a
march, then this movement is capable of other things. Boycotts, strikes,
fundraisers for your political opponents, influence in the media…</p>
<p>All those things <em>actually</em> cause headaches to politicians, and make change more
likely. The protest itself merely serves as a signal. A few decades ago, it was
a <em>strong</em> signal: only very powerful movements could put a large number of
people on the streets. So if you could pull off a large protest, it meant that
your movement could do all those other annoying things. Social media and
technological tools change this. With them, it's much easier to plan an event,
get the word out, and have many people rally around a cause for an afternoon.
This should be good news for protesters… Except it also means that large
protests are no longer such a show of strength. "Easier" also means "less
impressive". And the people in power have understood this.</p>
<p>Consider movements such as the anti-war demonstrations of the Bush era, Occupy,
or the more recent Woman's March. Politicians were able to pretty much ignore
protesters: once everyone gets home, nothing happens. Only the most motivated of
political opponents might cause <em>actual</em> issues later on. Worse, their number is
not directly related to the size of the protest itself. So the protest can be
very impressive (especially when comparing it with historical protests), and
still not scare anyone in power.</p>
<p>I picked this particular insight to try and convince you to read the book… But
that's obviously only a tiny part of what is there. Tufekci provides simple
concepts to understand how tech interacts with social movements. It's rigorous,
detailed, and illustrated with plenty of historical examples. The author doesn't
assume you know these examples already (even for "famous" events, like civil
rights movements in the US). This is great for people like me with a limited
knowledge of history ^^</p>
<p><em>Twitter and Tear Gas</em> doesn't only evoke protests. At the intersection between
tech and social movements, there are also misinformation campaigns, online
harassment, social network policies and their consequences… Each of those is
discussed in the book, always with the same academic rigor, lively examples, and
clear writing.</p>
<p>The book is an excellent read from an intellectual perspective: it made many
ideas <em>clearer</em> and <em>simpler to understand</em> for me. This feeling is the best
indicator I know of good science! But you can also read this book as an
instruction manual. How to build "muscle" for a movement, how to orient it
towards the most efficients means of action, how to deal with misinformation and
censorship… Using the technological tools that were developed in the last few
decades.</p>
<p>Everyone working in tech could probably benefit from reading <em>Twitter and Tear
Gas</em>. If you're an activist, I'd say it's pretty much required reading. Go buy
it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twitter-Tear-Gas-Fragility-Networked/dp/0300215126/">there</a> or <a href="http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300215120/twitter-and-tear-gas">there</a>, or if you can't afford it, <a href="https://www.twitterandteargas.org/downloads/twitter-and-tear-gas-by-zeynep-tufekci.pdf">download it for
free</a>: it's licensed under <a href="http://technosociology.org/?p=1751">Creative Commons</a>! (This excellent model of
publishing alone is a good reason to buy the book.)</p>
