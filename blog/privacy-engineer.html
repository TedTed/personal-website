    <p><strong>This</strong> is another one of <a href="part-time-phd.html">those posts</a> where I answer a
question I get regularly. What is it like being a privacy engineer? Besides a
cool job title, what does the job actually entail?</p>
<p>Before I even start, I need to point out a few major caveats of this post.</p>
<ul>
<li>My experience is not representative of privacy engineering as a whole. I'm
  sure it's different across companies, and even across people within the same
  company.</li>
<li>I have a particularly narrow view. I work on a sub-field of privacy
  (anonymization), and I've never led a team or hired privacy engineers.</li>
<li>"Privacy engineer" is not even my official job title. I still have my initial
  job title at Google: software engineer (<a href="part-time-phd.html">part-time</a>).
  Privacy engineering is definitely the job I do, though — they don't care
  much about job titles. I might switch at some point.</li>
<li>Like in all other entries from this blog, all opinions are mine and mine only.
  I'm only talking about my own experiences and feelings, and this post isn't
  vetted by my employers.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what do I do, on a daily basis, while working as a privacy engineer? I would
split the job responsibilities in three broad categories.</p>
<h2 id="consulting-with-teams">Consulting with teams</h2>
<p>A large part of my time is spent helping product teams get privacy right.</p>
<p>Back when I did generic privacy reviews, I checked future product launches for a
wide variety of things. Will users understand what happens with the data they
share? Is the data appropriately protected in transit and on-rest? Can the
product be misused and allow bad people to do evil<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>? Is the system collecting
only what is required for the product's functionality? Will it have a harmful
behavior in specific cases, or will it protect at-risk users properly<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>? Are
deletions handled correctly? </p>
<p>Some of this is compliance: making sure that the product aligns with existing
policies and regulations is important. This often isn't the focus point, though.
Everything that can be ticked off a checklist is usually pretty straightforward.
What's most complex and interesting is to identify what can go wrong in specific
scenarios.</p>
<p>How do I do this in practice? I read through design docs, slide decks and
sometimes code or demos to understand the product. I ask for additional
documentation when it's lacking. And poke at the system to see where it could
fail in unexpected and problematic ways. Then, I'll communicate the findings to
the team, and help them correct possible issues.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I'm in a group focused on anonymization, so I have a narrower focus.
Product teams come to us when they need to anonymize data, and we help them get
it right. We make sure they understand what they need to do and how to do it.
Then, we give them the green light when we end up on a solution we're
comfortable with.</p>
<p>This process is much easier when teams consult with privacy folks as soon as
possible. I love to be involved in early design discussions! It's in everyone's
interest. It avoids making choices that we'll regret later, which can save a lot
of engineering time. And if the team does the right thing in the first place,
that makes my job much easier at review time!</p>
<p>This part of the job requires lots of empathy. It's necessary to relate with
users, and understand what will create issues. It's also crucial to build
productive and respectful relationships with product teams. Luckily for me, it's
something that can be learned and improved over time. I wasn't very good at it
at first!</p>
<h2 id="building-things">Building things</h2>
<p>This is why the job title has « engineer » in it!</p>
<p>Finding issues in products is only the first step. Can we automate some of these
investigation methods? Make sure certain classes of problems don't happen in the
future? Detect failures early to prevent them from causing harm? These follow-up
questions can lead to impactful engineering projects.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Technical improvements to processes</em>: this is not a phenomenon limited to
  privacy. When engineers run processes, they'll detect inefficiencies, and
  identify automation opportunities. Building tooling to assist with
  checklist-type things is often a good idea. Time is better spent focusing on
  the complex and unique aspects of consultations!</li>
<li><em>Improving infrastructure</em>: baking privacy into your tech stack is an
  excellent investment. Suppose that some vetted storage system takes care of
  encryption and deletion correctly. You no longer need to worry about these
  aspects in a product that uses this system. That's a great way to save time
  and avoid problems! Privacy engineers are uniquely positioned to notice when
  this is worth doing.</li>
<li><em>Monitoring</em>: how do you check that products continue to behave as expected
  over time? Some problems might arise after the privacy review. Bugs happen.
  Code evolves over time. Changes might appear harmless, but have unintended
  consequences. Catching potential failures with automated monitoring before
  they harm anyone is very rewarding. And again, to know what to look for and
  how to detect privacy issues, you need domain experts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, it makes sense for a privacy engineer to take on such projects on
their own. This is especially true when there is a lot of specific expertise
involved, which is the case for my group: a large chunk of our work is about
building tools to make anonymization easier and safer. Sometimes, building a new
thing yourself is not the optimal move. It might make more sense to collaborate
with existing teams, or influence their roadmap.</p>
<p>This part of the job is like a classic software engineering job: writing design
docs, getting resources, writing and reviewing code, improving documentation,
writing tests… In my experience, though, there's often more communication
involved than on a typical project. The problems tackled are often very
horizontal: pain points shared across an entire organization, a new rule that
applies across the board… In these cases, maintaining technical alignment
between related efforts is crucial. Privacy engineers are in the perfect central
position to help with this aspect.</p>
<h2 id="setting-policy">Setting policy</h2>
<p>Privacy engineers try to make their organization do the right thing. But
who decides what the « right thing » is in the first place?</p>
<p>Turns out, it's also part of the job. Privacy engineers take high-level goals or
regulations and translate them into concrete, actionable requirements. Typical
privacy principles are broad and vague in nature, and have many interpretations.
This isn't great: people will have some <em>creative</em> ideas about how to put them
in application.</p>
<p>Being at the interface between non-technical stakeholders and engineers is
tricky, but necessary: if nobody does this job, it's not going to end well. And
it goes both ways! Helping policy makers understand what makes sense from a
technical perspective is crucial. Otherwise, you end up with inapplicable rules,
or counter-productive efforts.</p>
<p>In addition to that, policies don't all come from top-down regulations or
principles. It's frequent to stumble upon questions for which there is no
existing guidance. You often have to make judgment calls, and when you do, it's
important to document these decisions: this is the only way to keep them
consistent across products and over time. And doing that is, in effect, setting
an unofficial policy. Depending on how generalizable it is, it might be worth
turning it into official guidance.</p>
<p>I find policy work <em>way</em> more complex than consulting or engineering work. It
involves long discussions with a wide variety of people: lawyers, executives,
engineers, product managers… And it's critical to get right. Spending the time
to write great guidance is an investment that pays back many times over. And
inconsistent or inapplicable policies can have a huge damaging impact<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. So
it's sometimes frustrating, but also very challenging and rewarding.</p>
<p>In practice, what does policy work look like? Many meetings, long discussions on
docs, unending email threads. Yum!</p>
<h2 id="all-the-other-stuff">All the other stuff</h2>
<p>I lied! There's a fourth category. It's a catch-all, for all the extra
responsibilities besides the core ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Education</em>: you can't make every person in your organization a privacy
  expert, but it doesn't hurt to try! Giving talks and doing outreach is useful
  for many reasons. It helps orient people in the right general direction when
  designing new products.  It increases their awareness of potential issues, and
  makes them more likely to consult with experts early. It's also a great way to
  recruit! People you reach this way might later join your team, or become local
  privacy experts in their own team.</li>
<li><em>Proactive investigations</em>: poking at existing products outside of structured
  consultations can be worthwhile. Especially if nobody has looked at them in a
  while…</li>
<li><em>User advocacy</em>: privacy engineers try to make sure products aren't harmful to
  marginalized communities. As such, they have a duty to speak up when that's
  the case, even if it's not technically about privacy<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</li>
<li><em>Incident response</em>: bad stuff happens, and you need to have a process to make
  sure some people are ready to put out fires! Privacy engineers can be in such
  incident response roles. I never had such a role, though, so I don't know what
  it's like.</li>
<li><em>External outreach</em>: few privacy engineers do external outreach, even though
  they're in a unique position to do so. We could do better in that area, and
  collaborate more with academia and civil society. Luckily, most excellent
  folks are actively <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr19">improving</a> the
  situation on that front!</li>
<li><em>And a bunch of other engineering-related things</em>. You sometimes need to
  analyze data to quantify and prioritize issues. You want to keep educating
  yourself on new developments in the privacy space. You also need to pay
  attention to public discourse; it's crucial to better understand users, and
  anticipate new regulations. You sometimes want to run user studies to align
  your UIs with user expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure that I'm forgetting some aspects. You might be a privacy engineer and
this list might not feel very familiar. If that's the case, drop me a line! I'd
love to understand other perspectives on that topic. I hope you agree with me on
one thing, though: being a privacy engineer is challenging, fun and rewarding!</p>
<p>Now, there's a related question I also get sometimes: « being a privacy engineer
sounds awesome, how can I become one ? ». Unfortunately, I don't have a great
answer to that one. For me, it was pretty random. I joined Google as a software
engineer, switched to the privacy team because it sounded fun, and learned
everything I know there. I've heard good things about a <a href="http://privacy.cs.cmu.edu/">Master's degree at
CMU</a>… But apart from that, I don't know a lot of
educational opportunities. I'm not sure how to hunt for privacy engineering
jobs, either. I hope someone else writes a good answer to that question! Because
we definitely need more privacy engineers in industry.</p>

<p>There are lots of sub-questions here! Can a domestic abuser use the
  product to spy on their spouse? Can criminals take advantage of it to run
  online scams? Can political actors use it to spread disinformation?&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>Will your system deadname trans people, or unmask political activists? Are
  privacy-critical surfaces accessible and understandable to people with

<p>Dealing with 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> in software

<li id="fn:4">
<p>Things like ethics or ML fairness deserve specific processes and technical
  expertise. They're like security and privacy, complex and crucial to get
  right. But when these processes don't exist, they fall by default under the
  privacy umbrella. So existing practitioners have a duty to keep an eye on this
  sort of thing in the meantime.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
