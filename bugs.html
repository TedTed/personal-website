        <h1>First answer</h1>
        <p>It is normal. The webpage is under construction and is far from being
        a final version.</p>
        <h1>"But, still...</h1>
        <h3>... I can't kill the dragon!"</h3>
        <p>Yes you can. Try harder.</p>
        <h3>... I just died and I don't know why!"</h3>
        <p>The reason is printed above the map.</p>
        <h3>... The dragon walks on the pools and he doesn't die!"</h3>
        <p>That's because he flies over them. He has wings, you know.</p>
        <h3>... the direction keys make the page scroll!"</h3>
        <p>That's because you're not supposed to use them. I added a support for
        arrow keys for my grandparents. Real Nethack players use hjkl. See the
        <a href="./help.html" target=_blank>help page</a>.</p>
        <h3>... the dragon moves even when do nothing!"</h3>
        <p>That's because *all* non-recognized keys are seen as "wait for a
        turn" key. This is a feature, but it is not cool for the keyboards
        shorcuts in the navigator (Ctrl-T, for example). I will try to fix
        it soon.</p>
        <h3>... I can't find a key to do what I want to!"</h3>
        <p>If a key is not described in the help page, then it is not
        implemented. There are secret rooms, easter eggs and many hidden things,
        but no hidden key command.</p>
        <h3>... I can't do [something you usually do in Nethack]!"</h3>
        <p>Yeah, maybe I will implement later what you are looking for, maybe
        not. This is not supposed to be as complete as Nethack anyway. And
        considering how fast Javascript is, this would probably be a bad idea to
        implement every command from Nethack.</p>
        <h3>... I can't play correctly on my phone!"</h3>
        <p>Sorry for you, then. Save the URL of the page, and come back later on
        a real computer. I do not think it will ever be fit for tiny
        screens.</p> 
        <h3>... I can't use my touchscreen to play!"</h3>
        <p>You're kidding, right ?</p>
        <h3>... I can't play because I use [ pentadactyl | emacs | some other
            weird navigator ]!"</h3>
        <p>With pentadactyl or vimperator, there is a key to temporarly disable
        key bindings (Ctrl-Z on my pentadactyl configuration), so you can use it
        and it should be fine. If you can't disable your shortcuts easily or if
        you encounter problems with Javascript, you should (temporarly) switch
        to another navigator.</p>
        <h3>... I can't read the source code because all is in french!"</h3>
        <p>Well, then, I guess this is an excellent reason to learn it.</p>
        <h3>... I can't read the source code even if I know french!"</h3>
        <p>Sorry for that \o/</p>
        <h3>... I have found a *real* bug, which is not listed in this page!</h3>
        <p>Then, it would be nice to tell me about this bug, by sending me an
        e-mail. My adress is ddfontaines (at) gmail (dot) com. Thank you in
        advance !</p>
