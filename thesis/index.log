--- Note --- if included graphics are of degraded quality, try the command line
 options `graphics-num' or `graphics-'. The `num' should provide the density of
 pixels in the bitmaps (e.g., 110). 
--------------------------------------
--------------------------------------
--- Note --- for setting image dimensions, try the option `Gin-dim'; to use per
cents instead of units, use `Gin-perecent'; for key dimensions when bounding bo
x is unavailable try `Gin-dim+'; neither is recommended

Class scrreprt Warning: \float@addtolists detected!
(scrreprt)              Implementation of \float@addtolist became
(scrreprt)              deprecated in KOMA-Script v3.01 2008/11/14 and
(scrreprt)              has been replaced by several more flexible
(scrreprt)              features of package `tocbasic`.
(scrreprt)              Since Version 3.12 support for deprecated
(scrreprt)              \float@addtolist interface has been
(scrreprt)              restricted to only some of the KOMA-Script
(scrreprt)              features and been removed from others.
(scrreprt)              Loading of package `scrhack' may help to
(scrreprt)              avoid this warning, if you are using a
(scrreprt)              a package that still implements the
(scrreprt)              deprecated \float@addtolist interface.


Class scrreprt Warning: Redefinition of \@makechapterhead detected.
(scrreprt)              Note: KOMA-Script does use styles for commands like
(scrreprt)              \chapter. Currently it internally still provides and
(scrreprt)              uses \@makechapterhead, but a completely different
(scrreprt)              definition compared to the standard classes.
(scrreprt)              So redefining or using internal \@makechapterhead
(scrreprt)              by users or package authors may already break
(scrreprt)              KOMA-Script and will not work with a coming version,
(scrreprt)              that will remove this deprecated code.

Class scrreprt Warning: Redefinition of \@makechapterhead detected.
(scrreprt)              Note: KOMA-Script does use styles for commands like
(scrreprt)              \chapter. Currently it internally still provides and
(scrreprt)              uses \@makechapterhead, but a completely different
(scrreprt)              definition compared to the standard classes.
(scrreprt)              So redefining or using internal \@makechapterhead
(scrreprt)              by users or package authors may already break
(scrreprt)              KOMA-Script and will not work with a coming version,
(scrreprt)              that will remove this deprecated code.

Class scrreprt Warning: Redefinition of \@makechapterhead detected.
(scrreprt)              Note: KOMA-Script does use styles for commands like
(scrreprt)              \chapter. Currently it internally still provides and
(scrreprt)              uses \@makechapterhead, but a completely different
(scrreprt)              definition compared to the standard classes.
(scrreprt)              So redefining or using internal \@makechapterhead
(scrreprt)              by users or package authors may already break
(scrreprt)              KOMA-Script and will not work with a coming version,
(scrreprt)              that will remove this deprecated code.

Class scrreprt Warning: Redefinition of \@makechapterhead detected.

(scrreprt)              So redefining or using internal \@makechapterhead
